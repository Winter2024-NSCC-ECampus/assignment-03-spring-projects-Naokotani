# Example Spring Shell Application

This simple application is inteded to show the basic funtionality of the Spring Shell module. This module can be used to create interactive shell applications either as a stand alone application or as part of a large application.

# Usage

Compile and run the jar file in a terminal, and you will be presented with a prompt. You can input `help` to see a list of possible commands. To run the command in the example input `what-time-is-it`. This command has an optional argument with a default value of `evil`, but inputing `good` will change the behaviour of the output by the wolf not having the option to attack you (only evil wolves attack people).
